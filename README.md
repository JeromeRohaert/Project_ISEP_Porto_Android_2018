# Project_ISEP_Porto_Android_2018

End scholarship project at ISEP (Porto, Portugal)

This is the project we're doing at ISEP (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto) It's a web server with a web application which allows you to list movies, rate them, and get movie recommandations from those ratings.

We're also working on a mobile application. You can find it here : https://github.com/CesarWibaut/IsepProjectServer

The two projects are linked to the same databases.

We're using the movie database API to help us out https://www.themoviedb.org

We're using Volley library to help us with the requests to the server
